# TripBot First Run
Congrats on making it this far!

You have just a little more setup to complete:

1) Modify the .env file with your discord client ID and token
1.5) If you're not going to use TripSit's dev guild, then change the guild ID
2) In the top left there are three dots, enable NPM Scripts, then run the nodemon script

Notes:
* Nodemon will restart every time you save a file
